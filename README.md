Analysis script, insights and motivation

## Overview
This repository contains my analysis and insights for the behavioural finance task as part of the application process for the Behavioural/Data Science Intern position at Oxford Risk.

## Contents
analysis.ipynb: Main analysis script (Jupyter Notebook).

EDA_insights.docx: Brief exploratory data analysis summary and key insights.

assets_data.csv, personality_data.csv, combined.csv: Datasets used for the analysis.

## Motivation 
I am applying because I enjoy psychology-related research and am keen to pursue a career in data science within the financial sector. The intersection of personality psychology, behavioural finance, and data science in this role is therefore an ideal fit for my interests and aspirations. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to further develop my quantitative and analytical skills, by applying them to real-world financial decision-making, whilst learning from the Oxford Risk team.
